# Clothing-Recommendation-System
This repository contains a clothing recommendation system that predicts user preferences and suggests items they might be interested in. The project uses collaborative filtering techniques and neural network models to provide personalized recommendations based on user-item interactions. The model uses tensorflow and uses metrics based on user purchases and ratings. Note that this model is for a larger application that I've been working on, but can be applied to others using a similar concept. Data for this model are stored in a PostgreSQL database, but configure to whatever data source you're using, example CSV.

# Introduction
The Clothing Recommendation System aims to enhance the shopping experience by suggesting products that users are likely to purchase based on their past interactions and preferences. This is achieved through a combination of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation steps.

# Features
- User-Item Interaction Data: Collects and processes data related to user interactions with various clothing items.
- Neural Network Model: Utilizes a neural network to learn embeddings for users and items, providing accurate recommendations.
- Evaluation: Measures the performance of the recommendation model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Visualization: Provides visual insights into the model's performance and predictions.

# Installation
To get started with the Clothing Recommendation System, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Clothing-Recommendation-System.git
cd Clothing-Recommendation-System
```

Set up a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Results
The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE). Visualizations such as plots of predicted vs. actual ratings can provide further insights into the model's accuracy.
